Short story about me and my biggest dream (README ONLY)
- How did my IT story start?
- How I made progress, how I want to develop?
- What is my biggest goal?
  
### The story of an inquisitive child, or how it all began...

- Already as a young boy, I always liked to disassemble mechanical, electronic toys and construct "their own" from their parts. At the age of 10 my adventure with computers began.
- the first computer I used didn't have any games or high computing power, so I mainly unfolded it and have fun in the BIOS :D 
- with time I became interested in the IT world, more seriously
- When I discovered Arduino and Raspberry Pi, it was time to build the first serious remote controlled robots
- then I discovered my passion for Linux, it was also the time when I started my first job in IT, it was there that I learned many things that allowed me to self-improvement faster and better, and create documentation of my work. I met many fascinating people and technologies there. It was there that I realized that nothing is impossible in the IT world

### What is my biggest goal?
I have always loved animals, whenever possible I try to help organizations dealing with help for dogs. Some time ago when I bought a 3D printer, I thought I could do something amazing and crazy!  
> ""I would like to develop technologically advanced prostheses for needy dogs!"


I know that to produce the first prosthesis you need huge financial resources for materials and technology as well as to pay specialists, I will also encounter many difficulties in the sphere of bureaucracy and animal nature.  
But thanks to advanced 3D printing technology, electronics, IoE, artificial intelligence and perseverance I can achieve my goal!  
As soon as I accumulate capital that will allow me to achieve my goal, be ready to join my team if you want, until then I will continue to develop my skills that will bring me closer to my goal.  
First of all I will give advanced dentures to dogs looking for a home, especially those who have lost a limb by a human and therefore cannot find a loving home now.   
2 months ago, when I reached the age of majority, I was planning to create my foundation and a mini business, but COVID and the changes it brought mean if i have to put my plans off late  

I hope that on the path of my life there will be people who share my fascination with the world of IT and animals
